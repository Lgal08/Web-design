    <h1>Willy Wonka</h1>
    <hr>
<p> Willy wonka has had many movies made about him over the years. The original came out in 1971 staring <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000698/" target="_blank">Gene Wilder</a>. The remake in 2005 that is more know to me starred <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_johnn" target="_blank">Johnny Depp</a>. However I surprisingly loved the newest Wonka movie with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3154303/" target="_blank">Timothee Chalamet</a>. The movies always gave almost a fever dream feel. Also creepy in a way but somewhat wholsome. The movies are based on this quirky man who loves to make chocolate. However other competitors are trying to find out the secret to how he makes his chocolate so delicous. He goes on to make sure the factory is left in good hands by inviting many people into his factory and putting them through small tests to see who the next owner would be. </p>

<h2> Characters</h2>
<p> Like I've stated prevously Willy wonka has been played by three different men. I am biased because he's the Willy Wonka I grew up with but I think the best potrail was done by Johnny Depp. He's just very bizzare and confusing but his moves are all calculated at the same time. Timothe Chalamet was a good wonka becasue he showed how wonka came to be and how he's always had such original ideas when it came to chocolate. His portail of the character was very free spirited. He wasn't trying to give into the character Johnny Depp had made wonka become. He made his own version of wonka and I think it came across well. I am not completely familiar with the original Wonka played by Gene Wiler. I have watched it maybe once and he always gave weird creepy vibes. Johnny Depp did too so maybe he tried to steer in the same direction as Wilder.  </p>
